# geneticBasisOfASpontaneousMutationsExpressivity
Analysis to accompany R Schell, et al. 2021. Genetic basis of a spontaneous mutation's expressivity.

Relevant code is organized into three files for genetic mapping, statistical analyses, and figure plotting.
Necessary files for these analyses include 'DataS1_Genotype.txt', 'DataS2_Phenotype.txt', 'DataS3_ReciprocalHemizygosity.txt', 'DataS4_CloningExperiments.txt', 'DataS5_PetiteFrequency.txt', 'DataS6_ChromosomeIIDuplication.txt' processed data files which need to be in the working directory to accompany scripts.

## Code is arranged in order of presented data

## Note, code compatible, tested under R version 3.5.1 (2018-07-02) -- 'Feather Spray" on x86_64-apple-darwin15.6.0 (64-bit) platform and R version 3.6.2 (2019-12-12) -- "Dark and Stormy Night" on x86_64-apple-darwin15.6.0 (64-bit)
